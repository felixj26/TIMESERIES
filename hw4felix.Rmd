### **Exploratory Analysis**
```{r plot_time_series, echo=FALSE}
# Plot time series
autoplot(data_ts) +
  ggtitle("Google Stock Price Time Series (Last 5 Years)") +
  ylab("Closing Price") +
  xlab("Year") +
  theme_minimal()

# Decomposition
decomposed <- decompose(data_ts, type="multiplicative")
autoplot(decomposed) + ggtitle("Decomposed Google Stock Time Series (Last 5 Years)")

# Autocorrelation
Acf(data_ts, main = "Autocorrelation of Google Stock Data (Last 5 Years)")

# ADF Test for stationarity
data_diff <- diff(log(data_ts))
adf_result <- adf.test(data_diff)
print(paste("ADF Test p-value:", adf_result$p.value))
```

### **Model Fitting and Forecasting**
```{r}
# Naive method
naive_forecast <- naive(data_ts, h=12)
plot(naive_forecast, main="Naive Forecast (Last 5 Years)")

# Explanation: The naive method assumes the most recent observed value is the best forecast for future periods. It works well in stable, non-trending datasets but fails in the presence of trends or seasonality.

# Mean method
mean_forecast <- meanf(data_ts, h=12)
plot(mean_forecast, main="Mean Forecast (Last 5 Years)")

# Explanation: The mean method forecasts future values using the average of all past observations. It is a simple method but does not capture trends or seasonality effectively.

# Moving Averages
MA5_forecast <- ma(data_ts, order=5)
MA9_forecast <- ma(data_ts, order=9)

plot(data_ts)
lines(MA5_forecast, col="red")
lines(MA9_forecast, col="blue")

# Explanation: Moving averages smooth out fluctuations in the data by averaging a fixed number of past observations. It helps in identifying trends but does not predict future values effectively.

# Exponential Smoothing
ets_model <- ets(data_ts)
summary(ets_model)
ets_forecast <- forecast(ets_model, h=12)
plot(ets_forecast)

# Explanation: Exponential Smoothing assigns exponentially decreasing weights to past observations, giving more importance to recent values. It is useful for short-term forecasting but can struggle with sudden changes.

# Holt-Winters
HW_forecast <- HoltWinters(data_ts)
plot(HW_forecast)

# Explanation: The Holt-Winters method extends exponential smoothing by incorporating trend and seasonality components. It is one of the most effective models for time series with seasonal patterns.
```

### **Model Accuracy Comparison**
```{r}
# Compute accuracy measures
naive_acc <- accuracy(naive_forecast)
mean_acc <- accuracy(mean_forecast)
ets_acc <- accuracy(ets_forecast)

# Print accuracy tables
print(naive_acc)
print(mean_acc)
print(ets_acc)

# Compare RMSE
comparison <- data.frame(
  Model = c("Naive", "Mean", "ETS"),
  RMSE = c(naive_acc[1, "RMSE"], mean_acc[1, "RMSE"], ets_acc[1, "RMSE"])
)

print(comparison)

# Best model selection
best_model <- comparison[which.min(comparison$RMSE), ]
print(paste("The best model based on RMSE is:", best_model$Model))

# Explanation: The best model is determined based on RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), which measures the average magnitude of forecasting errors. The lower the RMSE, the better the model's predictive performance. The chosen model provides the most accurate forecast based on past data patterns.
