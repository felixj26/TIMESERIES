# Load necessary libraries

library(fpp2)

# Import the data
data(arrivals)

# Isolate the US Arrivals series (column 4)
ts <- arrivals[,4]

# Plot the time series
plot(ts, main="Time Series Plot of US Arrivals", ylab="Number of Arrivals", xlab="Time")

# Summary statistics of the time series
summary(ts)

# Observations
# - The plot shows an increasing trend over time.
# - There are seasonal fluctuations.
# - Some outliers or spikes may be present.
# - The variation in arrivals appears to increase over time, suggesting possible heteroscedasticity.

# Central Tendency
summary(ts)

# Show the box plot
boxplot(ts, main="Boxplot of US Arrivals", ylab="Arrivals")

# Observations from Summary & Boxplot
# - Min, Max, Mean, Median, 1st and 3rd Quartile values are displayed.
# - The boxplot helps visualize outliers and spread.
# - A right-skewed distribution might be present.
# - There appear to be outliers in the higher range of arrivals, suggesting occasional surges.

# Decomposition
ts_decomp <- decompose(ts)

# Plot the decomposition of the time series
plot(ts_decomp)

# Is the time series seasonal?
# - Yes, it is seasonal.

# Is the decomposition additive or multiplicative?
# - The decomposition method is additive.

# If seasonal, what are the values of the seasonal monthly indices?
ts_decomp$seasonal

# For which month is the time series value high, and for which month is it low?
# - The highest values typically occur during peak travel months (e.g., summer and holiday seasons).
# - The lowest values appear during off-peak seasons, possibly in winter.

# Can you think of the reason behind the high and low values in those months?
# - High values could be due to vacation travel, business events, and holidays.
# - Low values might be due to weather conditions, economic downturns, or non-peak travel periods.

# Overlay the seasonally adjusted time series
seasonally_adjusted <- seasadj(ts_decomp)
lines(seasonally_adjusted, col="red")

# Does seasonality have big fluctuations in the value of the time series?
# - Yes, the fluctuations in the seasonal component appear significant, indicating strong seasonal effects.

# Naïve Method
# Apply the naïve forecasting method
naive_forecast <- naive(ts)

# Plot the residuals
plot(naive_forecast$residuals, main="Residuals from Naïve Forecast", ylab="Residuals")

# - Indicates: The residuals appear to have a pattern, suggesting that the naïve method may not fully capture trends or seasonality.

# Histogram of residuals
hist(naive_forecast$residuals, main="Histogram of Residuals", xlab="Residuals", col="lightblue", breaks=20)

# - Indicates: The histogram suggests a slightly skewed distribution, implying that the residuals may not be normally distributed.

# Fitted values vs. residuals
plot(fitted(naive_forecast), naive_forecast$residuals, main="Fitted Values vs Residuals", xlab="Fitted Values", ylab="Residuals")

# - Indicates: A pattern in residuals suggests that the model does not fully explain the variability in the data.

# Actual values vs. residuals
plot(ts, naive_forecast$residuals, main="Actual Values vs Residuals", xlab="Actual Values", ylab="Residuals")

# - Indicates: The residuals may increase with larger values, suggesting possible heteroscedasticity.

# ACF plot of residuals
acf(na.omit(naive_forecast$residuals), main="Autocorrelation of Residuals")

# - Indicates: The presence of autocorrelation suggests that the residuals are not purely random, indicating the need for a more sophisticated forecasting model.

# Print five-number summary for the series
fivenum(ts)

# Compute five accuracy measures for the Naïve method
accuracy(naive_forecast)

# Generate a forecast for the next year
future_forecast <- forecast(naive(ts, h=12))

# Plot the forecast
plot(future_forecast, main="Naïve Forecast for Next Year", ylab="Number of Arrivals", xlab="Time")

# Show forecasted values
future_forecast

# How good is accuracy?
# - The accuracy measures indicate the level of error in the model.
# - If MAPE is high, the naïve model may not be a reliable predictor.

# What does it predict?
# - The naïve forecast extends the last observed value forward.
# - It assumes future values will be similar to the most recent ones, ignoring seasonality and trends.

# Other observations:
# - A better forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA or ETS) may improve accuracy.
# - Incorporating seasonality explicitly could reduce forecast error.
