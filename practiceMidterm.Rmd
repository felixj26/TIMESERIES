# Summary statistics of the time series
summary(ts)

#Please summarize your observations of the time series plot
#Observations
#-The plot shows an increasing trend over time.
#-There are seasonal fluctuations.
#-Some outliers or spikes may be present.

#Central Tendency
#What are the min, max, mean, median, 1st, and 3rd Quartile values of the times series?
summary(ts)
#Show the box plot.

#Can you summarize your observation about the time series from the summary stats and box plot?
#-Observations from Summary & Boxplot
#-Min, Max, Mean, Median, 1st and 3rd Quartile values are displayed.
#-The boxplot helps visualize outliers and spread.
#-A right-skewed distribution might be present.

#Decomposition
ts_decomp <- decompose(ts)

#Plot the decomposition of the time series.
plot(ts_decomp)
#Is the time series seasonal?
#-Yes, it is seasonal
#Is the decomposition additive or multiplicative?
#-The decomposition method is additive
#If seasonal, what are the values of the seasonal monthly indices?
#-Seasonal indices can be extracted from ts_decomp$seasonal.
#For which month is the time series value high, and for which month is it low?
#-
#Can you think of the reason behind the high and low values in those months?
#-
# Overlay the seasonally adjusted time series

#Does seasonality have big fluctuations in the value of time series?
